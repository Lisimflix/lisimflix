# Contributing to Lisimflix

Design: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-24-lisimflix-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-24-lisimflix-design.md).

## One-time setup

```sh
gh repo clone Lisimflix/lisimflix
cd lisimflix
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The pre-push hook refuses pushes to `main`. Our GitHub plan can't protect
`main` on a private repo, so this hook plus the rules below is the protection.
Never bypass it with `--no-verify`.

## Workflow

1. Every change starts from an issue (except tiny docs fixes).
2. Branch off an up-to-date `main`: `git switch main && git pull && git switch -c feat/short-name`.
3. Commit small and often.
4. Push the branch and open a PR. Fill in the template; `Closes #N` links the issue.
5. Another member reviews and approves. Don't merge your own PR unreviewed.
6. Merge with **Squash and merge**. The branch is deleted automatically.

## Naming

- Branches: `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`, `chore/…`, `refactor/…`, `test/…`
- PR titles (they become the squashed commit message) use
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat(transcode): add HEVC remux`, `fix(web): …`.
  Scope matches the area label (`area:transcode` → `transcode`).

## Never commit

Secrets, `.env` files, media files, or build output. Test media goes in `testdata/`.
